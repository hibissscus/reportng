ReportNG is a simple HTML reporting plug-in for the TestNG unit-testing framework. It is intended as a replacement for the default TestNG HTML report.

The default report is comprehensive but is not so easy to understand at-a-glance. ReportNG provides a simple, colour-coded view of the test results.
